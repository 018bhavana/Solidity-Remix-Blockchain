This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly smart contracts written in Solidity and deployed using the Remix IDE. The objective is to explore core concepts in blockchain development, including:

**Variable handling and visibility modifiers

Ether transfer using transfer and call

Contract pausing and self-destruction

Structs and mappings for transaction logs

Error handling with require, assert, and revert

Receive and fallback functions

Inheritance and access control using modifiers

Event logging and return values**

Each .sol file corresponds to a focused topic covered in a Blockchain Technology lab session. This project serves as a great starting point for learners stepping into Ethereum-based development.
